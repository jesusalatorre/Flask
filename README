README

These are a look into my Flask learning process.

Remember to run these on ACTIVATED virtual environments, or else they just won't run.

hello.py is a Hello World-type application. It comes with the added feature of a second, dynamic route that greets you by name when navigating to localhost:5000/user/YOUR_NAME_HERE.

useragent.py just tells your the browser you are currently on, it is an exercise into contexts.

returncookie.py is an exercise into responses and return objects, and is pretty self-explanatory.

redirect.py is another exercise into responses and return objects, and redirects you to my 'About' page (:

abort.py is yet another of these, but it is used for error handling. It is meant to return 404 if the id given in the URL isn't an actual user

hellotemplates.py is an exercise into the use of templates. Try adding /index to the URL and /user/your_name to test these 2 templates out properly out properly.
